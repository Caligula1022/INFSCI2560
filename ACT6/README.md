## Topic

This is an anime that I've been enjoying a lot lately, so I'm going to make a simple introduction site for it.

## HTML Pages

1. The homepage shows a trailer for the anime and a cool button to display the trailer.

2. The story page shows a brief description of the anime's plot in a font that fits the cyberpunk style.

3. The character page shows the portraits of the hero and heroine, their names and character profiles through a table.

4. The gallery page shows six screenshots of the anime.

5. The preview page shows the opening and ending music of the anime, which can be switched by the button below.

## html elements

I use many kinds of html elements. For example, article, which is used because it can represent a separate piece of content, and section, which can be used to more clearly delineate the content area, and main, which can represent the only one main content, and table, which is convenient to use to display data or photos, and img, which is of course used to insert images. As for the video, I chose the embed element to embed the youtube video into the page.

## css elements

In all five pages, the main css attributes I used to modify the html elements are: font, background, color, float, display, position, margin, padding, text-transform, text-shadow, img, embed and many more. Among other things, I borrowed and learned from the cyberpunk style button on the codepen site, which I think is very cool and fits my theme well.

## Js

The js script I provided mainly has the following functions:

1. Show hidden video by key in home page
2. Switch different videos by key in preview page
3. Show default background by key in every page
4. Show new background by key in every page
5. Hover your mouse over the title in the upper right corner and see what happens?

Also added eventlistener to listen to events(click, mouseover, mouseout)
